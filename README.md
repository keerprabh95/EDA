This is my project related to dataset based on the banking industry.
This study is aimed at identifying patterns to indicate if a client has a difficulty paying the EMIs,
which can be used to take action like reducing loan amounts, providing loans at higher interest rate or even 
denying loans if the need arises. Identification of customers capable of paying the EMIs are not to be rejected. 
Even the factors which can cause the default from a customer are also identified. 
The banking industry can then use this information to build its portfolio and risk assessment strategy.
